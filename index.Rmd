This document is a draft. 

INPUT DATA:

Input data consist of a set of time series corresponding to different sessions of Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl which have been done in five different fashions (classe): {A,B,C,D,E}. Training and test sets are provided. 

OBJECTIVE:

The objective is to train a predictor in order to identify the "classe".

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
